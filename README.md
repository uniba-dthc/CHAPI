# Goals

-  a stable, mobile platform on which a camera could be mounted in multiple orientations
-  a method of automatically measuring distance with a resolution sufficient for a dense photogrammetric network
-  a method of automatically triggering a camera tethered to a laptop
-  a low-cost solution that was also easy to assemble/disassemble for transport.
