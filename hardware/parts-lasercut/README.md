Parts for laser cutting were either  created with inkscape or in case of boxes created with [poxes.py ](https://www.festi.info/boxes.py/) and afterwords modified with incscape to add more features.
For some parts there are previous versions and experimental files available. Final versions of a part have the `_path` at the end of the filename.
