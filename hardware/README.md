# Overview

![](hardware/chapi_parts_annotated.jpg)

CHAPI is constructed to be assembled and dissembled for ease of transportation. 
As of now the only tool needed is a singe allen key, with the goal of converting all joints to tool less fasteners in the future.


# Setup

1. Fold up the walking frame and extend the handles to a comfortable height.
2. Attach the wooden top plate to the walking frame.
3. Attach the construction profiles to the frame by sliding them onto the gliders.
4. Build with the other construction profiles to the desired height and angle.
5. Connecting the main brain to all the sensors and laptop is just plug and play.
	1. Connect the hall sensor next to the wheel.
	2. Connect the button on the handle.
	3. Connect the laptop to the Raspberry Pi Pico on the side of the main brain.
	4. Connect the main brain ESP32 to a power source, such as a power bank.
6. Add the camera and connect it to the laptop.

Happy imaging!
