CHAPI incorporates different concepts previously explored on different locations we did surveys. 




# Weikersheim and Dresden

While the features of Weikersheim and Dresden were completely different, one being a well persevered and the other being a bombed out in the second world war, the setup was nearly identical.
We had over 8m clearance to the ceiling and had a completely empty room.
We secured a tripod on a small portable golf cart and attached three (Weikersheim) or four (Dresden) cameras on a bar.

# Ansbach

In Ansbach the 250mÂ² ceiling is undergoing major restoration work and thus a scaffolding platform covers the entire area of the hall, with an approximate 2m clearance to the ceiling. 
The scaffolding enabled the imaging of the fresco in high resolution from close range, but also provided us with the challenge of camera placement within limited space.
Our first step of taking on that challenge was to tape a camera to a rolling board we had at hand for moving our equipment around. 
Also we conducted a test with a tripod on its smallest extension for capturing the wall parts of the fresco.
Both setups were operated by two persons, one moving the board around in a planed out grid, the other one operating a laptop for validating the image quality and giving instructions to the board person.
